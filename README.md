## About

uffa (Untitled Framework For API) is a web framework using [**VANILLA PHP**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vanilla_software). No third parts, no composer,... just using PHP as it is. We believe development must be clean, without unnecessary libraries or something that just pollutes your code to do simple routines.

It isn't about reinventing the wheel, but if something is simple, why whould you use a "solution" with multiples conditionals and loops that don't make sense for your project?

 * It is simple, run a command and handle your endpoint
 * No multile migration files. Your model is your database!
 * Simples config file (a JSON! Why not?)
 * Fast! No unnecessary conditionals. If it isn't correct, it doesn't run. That simple :)

## Security
If you discover a security vulnerability, please open an issue, or PR fixing it,... Follow your heart :)
